### Problems
- [ ] VSCode complains about inconsistent tabs and spaces, but hitting tab creates spaces...

### Todo
- [ ] Instead of relying on `clock.tick(FRAMERATE)`, use delta time (`dt`) for frame-independent movement (watch clearcode)
- [ ] Fix music volume
- [ ] Add mute option for music
- [ ] Add high score to txt file (TODO rewatch Clear Code video about JSON files)
- [ ] Add pause function
- [ ] Add option to turn off CRT effect?
- [ ] Add volume bar and control
- [ ] Add game over menu
- [ ] Add intro menu
- [ ] Make controller work after it's been plugged in while the game is running?
- [ ] More speed at higher levels? Increase opponent and ball speed with every score
- [ ] Add powerups...?
